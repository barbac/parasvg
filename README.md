# parasvg

The idea is to parameterize svg files so they can adjust to given measurements.

## Demo
only works on firefox at the moment due to chrome deleting some old svg api.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
